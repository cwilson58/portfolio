                                    This was an ENSE 352, fundamentals of computer architecture, class project to build whack-a-mole on a Nucleo64 board in Arm assembly.
                                    Due to the fact that this is a common class project, I wont make my versions source code public. <br>
                                    
                                    The basic idea of the project was to take a circuit that was designed by our lab instructor and write the code that will handle output to 4 LED's
                                    as well as the input of 4 push buttons. <br>
                                    
                                    My version added a fifth LED (Yellow), I had to find an I/O pin and use correct circuitry to add this. This Fifth LED was to improve user interaction with
                                    the game. It was used as a "score indicator", it would be solid for scores from 1 - 14, and flash if the score was zero or greater than 15.
                                    The score was displayed in binary on the four LED's used to play the game, so having indication using a 5th LED that the score was being displayed
                                    allowed for the user to know the game is working as intended. <br> 
                                    
                                    The other additional feature I added was a difficulty selection, each of the 4 buttons gave you a range of easy to impossible reaction times. All of these times are
                                    able to be modified in the source codes, in the end the project worked as intended. <br>

                                    since this is a very common class project, I have elected to keep the code private.
